Short-Circuit Currents
=======================

The short-circuit currents are calculated with the equivalent voltage source at the fault location.  
For an explanation of the theory behind short-circuit calculations according to IEC 60909
please refer to the norm or secondary literature:

pandapower currently implements symmetrical and two-phase faults. One phase faults and two-phase faults with earthing are not yet available.
