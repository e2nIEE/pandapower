Transforming network geodata from any projection to wgs84 (lat/long)
====================================================================

In case network geodata are not in The World Geodetic System (WGS84), that is latitude/longitude format, but in some of
the map-projections, it may be converted to lat/long by providing number of the projection.
A sample of converting geodata from mv_oberrhein network can be found in the tutorial.
