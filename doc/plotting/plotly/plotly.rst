Plotly Network Plots
#############################

pandapower provides interactive network plots using `Plotly <https://plot.ly/python/>`_.
These plots are built with arguments and functionalities to be as much as possible analogous with pandapower's
matlpotlib plotting library.
There is a functionality to translate pandapower network elements into plotly collections (traces).
The different collections for lines, buses or transformers can than be drawn.

In order to get idea about interactive plot features and possibilities see the `tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/e2nIEE/pandapower/blob/develop/tutorials/plotly_built-in.ipynb>`_.


If a network has geocoordinates, there is a possibility to represent interactive plots on `Mapbox <https://www.mapbox.com/>`_ maps.

.. note::

    Plots on Mapbox maps are available only considering you have a Mapbox account and a `Mapbox Access Token <https://www.mapbox.com/studio>`_.
    After getting a mabox token it can be set to pandapower as the following ::

        from pandapower.plotting.plotly.mapbox_plot import set_mapbox_token
        set_mapbox_token('<token>')
