SimBench Grids
==========================

SimBench is a research project to create a simulation database for uniform comparison of innovative
solutions in the field of network analysis, network planning and operation, which was
conducted for three and a half years from 1.11.2015 to 30.04.2019. The project was carried out by
the University of Kassel, the Fraunhofer IEE, the RWTH Aachen University and the Technical
University of Dortmund.
The dataset of electrical transmission and distribution grids can be used as a test grid to perform
studies and as benchmark grid to publish and compare your study results
SimBench Grid differs from other benchmark grids under the following key points:

- Consideration of a wide range of use cases during the development of data sets
- Provision of grid data for low voltage, medium voltage, high voltage, extra high voltage as well as design of data sets for a suitable interconnection of a grid among different voltage levels for cross-level simulations
- Ensuring highreproducibility and comparability by providing clearly assigned load and generation time series
- Validation of the suitability of the data sets with simulation, deliberately determined grid states including suitable dimensioning of grid assets

The focus of the data sets is Germany. If possible, the SimBench data set should also be applicable in an international context.
