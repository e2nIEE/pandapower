Besides creating your own grids through the pandapower API, pandapower provides synthetic and
Benchmark networks through the networks module.

The pandapower networks modul contains example networks, simple test networks, randomly generated
networks, CIGRE test networks, IEEE case files and synthetic low voltage networks from Georg Kerber
and Lindner et. al. and Dickert et. al..

If you like to test your algotihms with benchmark grids and corresponding full-year load, generation
and storage profiles or want to publish your results, we recommend you to have look to SimBench
(`Homepage <https://simbench.de/en/>`_, `GitHub Repository to use SimBench with pandapower <https://github.com/e2nIEE/simbench>`_).

You can find documentation for the individual network modules of pandapower here:
