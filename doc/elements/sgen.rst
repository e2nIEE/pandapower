==================
Static Generator
==================

.. note::

   Static generators should always have a positive p_mw value, since all power values are given in the generator convention. If you want to model constant power consumption, it is recommended to use a load element instead of a static generator with negative active power value.
   If you want to model a voltage controlled generator, use the generator element.

Static Generator Reactive Power Capability Curve Characteristics
==========================

The static generator reactive power capability curve characteristics provide a reference framework for determining the
reactive power limits (Qmin and Qmax) of static generators based on their active power output.
The reactive power capability curve data can be imported into pandapower in a tabular format, populating
net.q_capability_curve_table. This table is either auto-generated via the CIM CGMES to pandapower converter,
provided this information is available in the Equipment (EQ) profile, or it can be manually defined by the user.

Q capability curve characteristic objects are then generated from net.q_capability_curve_table, populating
net.q_capability_curve_characteristic. The characteristics are either auto-generated via the CIM CGMES to pandapower
converter or they can be created by the user via the pandapower.control.util.create_q_capability_curve_characteristics_object
function, provided q_capability_curve_table is previously defined in the network case.

If the variable reactive_capability_curve in net.sgen is set to True, it indicates that pairs of P vs Qmin/Qmax values
and the corresponding characteristic are defined in net.q_capability_curve_table and net.q_capability_curve_characteristic
respectively. This overrides the default reactive power limits of the static generator when an optimal power flow
is executed for static generators that have their "controllable" flag set to True.
The variable id_q_capability_curve_characteristic in net.sgen establishes a direct reference to the
id_q_capability_curve column in both net.q_capability_curve_table and net.q_capability_curve_characteristic, thereby
associating each static generator with its corresponding capability curve.

Below is an example of a q_capability_curve_table populated for two sample static generators.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.55\linewidth}|p{0.15\linewidth}|p{0.55\linewidth}
.. csv-table::
   :file: sgen_q_char_table.csv
   :delim: ,
   :widths: 10, 10, 55, 55, 55

The table below illustrates an example of a q_capability_curve_characteristic table populated for two static generators.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.55\linewidth}|p{0.55\linewidth}
.. csv-table::
   :file: gen_q_char_table_object.csv
   :delim: ,

.. note::
    - reactive_capability_curve has to be set to True, and id_q_capability_curve_characteristic and curve_style variables
      need to be populated in order to consider the reactive power limits of the corresponding characteristic.
    - Each static generator supports only a single reactive_capability_curve.
    - In this version, only two types of generator reactive power capability characteristics are supported:
      1. constantYValue: The reactive power values are assumed constant until the next curve point and prior to the first curve point.
      2. straightLineYValues: The reactive power values are assumed to be a straight line between values.
    - Linear interpolation is employed to determine Qmin and Qmax based on the given active power dispatch for the above two curve types.

The function pandapower.control.util.q_capability_curve_table_diagnostic is available to perform sanity checks
on the generator reactive power capability curve table.

Electric Model
=================

Static Generators are modelled as PQ-buses in the power flow calculation:

.. image:: pq.png
	:width: 8em
	:alt: alternate Text
	:align: center
    
The PQ-Values are calculated from the parameter table values as:

.. math::
   :nowrap:
   
   \begin{align*}
    P_{sgen} &= p\_mw \cdot scaling \\
    Q_{sgen} &= q\_mvar \cdot scaling \\
    \end{align*}

.. note::
    
    The apparent power value sn_mva is provided as additional information for usage in controller or other applications based on pandapower. It is not considered in the power flow!

Result Parameters
==========================
*net.res_sgen*

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.10\linewidth}|p{0.50\linewidth}|
.. csv-table:: 
   :file: sgen_res.csv
   :delim: ;
   :widths: 10, 10, 50

The power values in the net.res_sgen table are equivalent to :math:`P_{sgen}` and :math:`Q_{sgen}`.
