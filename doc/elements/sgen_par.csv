**Parameter**;**Datatype**;**Value Range**;**Explanation**
name;string;;name of the static generator
type;string;"| naming conventions:
| *""PV""* - photovoltaic system
| *""WP""* - wind power system
| *""CHP""* - combined heating and power system";type of generator
bus*;integer;;index of connected bus
p_mw*;float;:math:`\leq` 0;active power of the static generator [MW]
q_mvar*;float;;reactive power of the static generator [MVAr]
sn_mva;float;:math:`>` 0;rated power ot the static generator [MVA]
scaling*;float;:math:`\geq` 0;scaling factor for the active and reactive power
max_p_mw**;float;;maximum active power [MW]
min_p_mw**;float;;minimum active power [MW]
max_q_mvar**;float;;maximum reactive power [MVAr]
min_q_mvar**;float;;minimum reactive power [MVAr]
controllable**;bool;;states if sgen is controllable or not, sgen will not be used as a flexibility if it is not controllable
k***;float;:math:`\geq` 0;ratio of short circuit current to nominal current
rx***;float;:math:`\geq` 0;R/X ratio for short circuit impedance. Only relevant if type is specified as motor so that sgen is treated as asynchronous motor
in_service*;boolean;True / False;specifies if the generator is in service.
id_q_capability_characteristic;integer;;references the index of the characteristic from the q_capability_characteristic
curve_style;string;either "straightLineYValues" or "constantYValue";the style of the static generator reactive power capability curve
reactive_capability_curve;boolean;True / False;True if static generator has dependency on q characteristic
