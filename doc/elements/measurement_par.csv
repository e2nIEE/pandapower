**Parameter**;**Datatype**;**Value Range**;**Explanation**
type;string;"| ""p""
| ""q""
| ""i""
| ""v""";Defines what physical quantity is measured
element_type;string;"| ""bus""
| ""line""
| ""trafo""
| ""trafo3w""
| ""load""
| ""gen""
| ""sgen""
| ""shunt""
| ""ward""
| ""xward""
| ""ext_grid""";Defines which element type is equipped with the measurement
value;float;;Measurement value
std_dev;float;;Standard deviation (same unit as measurement)
bus;int;"| must be in 
| net.bus.index";"Defines the bus at which the measurement is placed. 
For line or transformer measurement, it defines the side at which the measurement is placed (from_bus or to_bus)."
element;int;must be an existing element index;"If the element_type is ""line"", ""trafo"", ""trafo3w"", ""load"", ""gen"", ""sgen"", ""shunt"", ""ward"", ""xward"" or ""ext_grid"", element is the index of the relevant element. For ""bus"" measurements, it is None (default)"
check_existing;bool;;Checks if a measurement of the type already exists and overwrites it. If set to False, the measurement may be added twice (unsafe behaviour), but the performance increases
index;int;;Defines a specific index for the new measurement (if possible)
