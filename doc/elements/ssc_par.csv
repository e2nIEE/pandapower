**Parameter**;**Datatype**;**Value Range**;**Explanation**
name;string;;name of the SSC
bus*;integer;;index of bus where the SSC is connected
r_ohm*;float;:math:`\geq` 0;resistance of the coupling transformer component of SSC
x_ohm*;float;:math:`\leq` 0;reactance of the coupling transformer component of SSC
set_vm_pu*;float;;set-point for the bus voltage magnitude at the connection bus
vm_internal_pu*;float;;The voltage magnitude of the voltage source converter VSC at the SSC component.
va_internal_degree*;float;;The voltage angle of the voltage source converter VSC at the SSC component.
controllable*;boolean;True / False;whether the element is considered as actively controlling or as a fixed shunt impedance
in_service*;boolean;True / False;specifies if the SSC is in service.
