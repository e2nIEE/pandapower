    "# Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) (OST) with PowerModels.jl\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to run the OST feature of PowerModels.jl together with pandapower.\n",
    "The OST allows to optimize the \"switching state\" of a (meshed) grid by taking lines out of service. This not exactly the\n",
    "same as optimizing the switching state provided by pandapower. In the OST case **every in service branch element** \n",
    "in the grid is taken into account in the optimization. This includes all lines and transformers. The optimization\n",
    "then chooses some lines/transformers to be taken out of service in order to minimize fuel cost (see objective on PM website).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summerize this means:\n",
    "* the switching state of the pandapower switches are **not** changed\n",
    "* all lines / transformer in service states are variables of the optimization\n",
    "* output of the optimization is a changed \"in_service\" state in the res_line / res_trafo... tables.   \n",

    "The OST problem is a mixed-integer non-linear problem, which is hard to solve. To be able to solve \n",
