    "With the TDPF calculation, the resulting overhead line temperature appears in the net.res_line table. This means that the line temperature is always initialized with 20 °C. If the TDPF is calculated for steady-state conditions, which is a valid approach for the time steps of ~1 hour, there is no need for any special consideration of the initial line temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if shorter time steps are used, e.g. 15 min, thermal inertia must be considered. The resulting temperature from the previous time step needs to be used as the starting temperature for the next tinme step. To achieve this, the value from net.res_line.temperature_degree_celsius must be written in net.line.temperature_degree_celsius. The reference temperature for calculating the resistance is not impacted by this change because it is stored in a separate column in net.line.reference_temperature_degree_celsius.\n",

The results show that the line temperature reaches the values of the steady-state calculation after several time steps. The curve representing the time resolution of 15 min (1 hour is equivalent to 4 time steps) crosses the curve of the steady-state calculation at the fifth time step. For the resolution of 5 min (1 hour is equivalent to 12 time steps), the crossing happens at the 11th time step. In both cases, the curve with thermal inertia catches up with the steady-state curve after about 1 hour. Therefore, considering thermal inertia is relevant for time series simulation with the time resolution of less than 1 hour."
