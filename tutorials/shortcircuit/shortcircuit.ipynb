    "\n",
    "The following short-circuit currents can be calculated:\n",
    "- ikss (Initial symmetrical short-circuit current)\n",
    "- ip (short-circuit current peak)\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition, short-circuit calculation with the superposition method is implemented. With this method, the pre-fault voltage is considered. The following differences to the worst-case calculation apply:\n",
    "- transformer correction factor is not applied\n",
    "- load, sgen are additionally modelled as shunt admittances (calculated based on their pre-fault currents)\n",
    "- the grid must contain the results of a successful power flow calculation\n",
