    "# Building a Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "The following documents the development of a new controller.\n",
    "In this case we are going to implement an arbitrary controllable storage unit.\n",
    "This may be a battery, an electrically powered car or some sort of reservoir storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling a Battery\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simulate a storage system we use the storage element of pandapower.\n",
    "The power of a storage can be positive or negative.\n",
    "To overcome this issue, a storage element can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "For storage elements the signing is based on the consumer viewpoint (positive active power means power consumption and therefore charging of the battery).\n",
    "\n",
    "As pandapower is not a time dependent simulation tool and there is no time domain parameter in default power flow calculations,\n",
    "the state of charge (SoC) is not updated during any power flow calculation.\n",
    "In Order to update the SoC we build our own storage controller and keep track of the SoC.\n",
    "\n",
    "State of charge (SoC [%]) is the level of charge of an electric battery relative to its capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controller init\n",
    "\n",
    "First we start by creating a new file *control/storage_control.py*, containing our new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Import and inherit from the parent class `Controller` and override methods you would like to use. Next we write the actual code for the methods."
