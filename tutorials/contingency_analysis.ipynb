    "\n",
    "The library lightsim2grid implements its own contingency analysis function in C++, which provides at least a magnitude of performance improvement in comparison to the pandapower function. The caveats are that not all possible features (e.g. trafo3w) of pandapower grid modeling are compatible with this particular implementation, and that buses must have a continuous index starting with 0. If the pandapower grid model has incompatible features, a warning is shown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there can be a difference in results between pandapower and lightsim2grid calculations due to some implementation differences. The results of the contingency analysis are related to the \"from_bus\" of lines and the \"hv_bus\" of transformers in lightsim2grid, but in pandapower the maximum value between \"from_bus\" and \"to_bus\" (\"hv_bus\" and \"lv_bus\") is used. In addition, if a contingency leads to an isolated island in the grid, the results for the contingency are set to _nan_ in lightsim2grid. However, pandapower selects a _gen_ element authomatically in such an isolated island as a new slack, and has values as results for such a contingency. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the pandapower grid model has an _ext\\_grid_ element as slack (as is most commonly the case), lightsim2grid will show warnings that it will attempt to use it as a slack generator. In order to avoid such warnings, we advise converting the _ext\\_grid_ element to a _gen_ element with True for _slack_ parameter and set the _slack\\_weight_ parameter to 1. This can be accomplished using the convenience function `pandapower.toolbox.replace_ext_grid_by_gen()`.\n",
