"""Defines constants for named column indices to TCSC matrix.

Some examples of usage, after defining the constants using the line above,
are:

    tcsc[3, TCSC_STATUS] = 0              # take TCSC 4 out of service
    Pset = tcsc[:, TCSC_SET_P]            # extract TCSC power set point vector

The index, name and meaning of each column of the TCSC matrix is given
below:

columns 0-9 must be included in input matrix (tcsc in ppc dict)
    0.  C{TCSC_F_BUS}                       TCSC from bus number
    1.  C{TCSC_T_BUS}                       TCSC to bus number
    2.  C{TCSC_X_L}                         inductive reactance (p.u.)
    3.  C{TCSC_X_CVAR}                      capacitive reactance (p.u.)
    4.  C{TCSC_SET_P}                       TCSC active power set point (p.u.)
    5.  C{TCSC_THYRISTOR_FIRING_ANGLE}      TCSC thyristor firing angle (radians)
    6.  C{TCSC_STATUS}                      initial TCSC status, 1 - in service, 0 - out of service
    7.  C{TCSC_CONTROLLABLE}                controllability flag for TCSC
    8.  C{TCSC_MIN_FIRING_ANGLE}            minimum thyristor firing angle (radians)
    9.  C{TCSC_MAX_FIRING_ANGLE}            maximum thyristor firing angle (radians)

columns 10-16 are filled with values after power flow

    10. C{PF}                               real power injected at "from" bus end (MW)
    11. C{QF}                               reactive power injected at "from" bus end (MVAr)
    12. C{PT}                               real power injected at "to" bus end (MW)
    13. C{QT}                               reactive power injected at "to" bus end (MVAr)
    14. C{IF}                               current injected at "from" bus end (kA)
    15. C{IT}                               current injected at "to" bus end (kA)
    16. C{TCSC_X_PU}                        reactance in per unit (p.u.)
