Defines constants for named column indices to SSC matrix.

Some examples of usage, after defining the constants using the lines above,
are::

    ssc[3, SSC_STATUS] = 0                  # take SSC 4 out of service
    SSC_Q = ssc[:, SSC_Q]                   # extract reactive power vector

The index, name, and meaning of each column of the SSC matrix are given below:

columns 0-9 must be included in the input matrix (ssc in ppc dict)
    0.  C{SSC_BUS}                      SSC bus number
    1.  C{SSC_INTERNAL_BUS}             Internal bus number for SSC
    2.  C{SSC_R}                        SSC coupling transformer resistance (p.u.)
    3.  C{SSC_X}                        SSC coupling transformer reactance (p.u.)
    4.  C{SSC_SET_VM_PU}                SSC bus voltage magnitude set point (p.u.)
    5.  C{SSC_STATUS}                   Initial SSC status, 1 - in service, 0 - out of service
    6.  C{SSC_CONTROLLABLE}             Controllability flag for SSC
    7.  C{SSC_X_CONTROL_VA}             SSC internal voltage angle (radians)
    8.  C{SSC_X_CONTROL_VM}             SSC internal voltage magnitude (p.u.)
    9.  C{SSC_Q}                        reactive power absorbed (+) or injected (-) by SSC (MVAr)
