"""Defines constants for named column indices to SVC matrix.

Some examples of usage, after defining the constants using the lines above,
are::

    svc[3, SVC_STATUS] = 0              # take SVC 4 out of service
    SVC_Q = svc[:, SVC_Q]               # extract reactive power vector

The index, name, and meaning of each column of the SVC matrix are given below:

columns 0-10 must be included in the input matrix (in case file)
    0.  C{SVC_BUS}                          SVC bus number
    1.  C{SVC_X_L}                          inductive reactance (p.u.)
    2.  C{SVC_X_CVAR}                       capacitive reactance (p.u.)
    3.  C{SVC_SET_VM_PU}                    SVC bus voltage magnitude set point (p.u.)
    4.  C{SVC_THYRISTOR_FIRING_ANGLE}       SVC thyristor firing angle (radians)
    5.  C{SVC_STATUS}                       initial SVC status, 1 - in service, 0 - out of service
    6.  C{SVC_CONTROLLABLE}                 controllability flag for SVC
    7.  C{SVC_MIN_FIRING_ANGLE}             minimum thyristor firing angle (radians)
    8.  C{SVC_MAX_FIRING_ANGLE}             maximum thyristor firing angle (radians)
    9.  C{SVC_Q}                            reactive power absorbed (+) or injected (-) by SVC (MVAr)
    10. C{SVC_X_PU}                         reactance in per unit (p.u.)
