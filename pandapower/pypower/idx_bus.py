"""Defines constants for named column indices to bus matrix.

Some examples of usage, after defining the constants using the line above,
are::

    Pd = bus[3, PD]     # get the real power demand at bus 4
    bus[:, VMIN] = 0.95 # set the min voltage magnitude to 0.95 at all buses

The index, name and meaning of each column of the bus matrix is given
below:

columns 0-12 must be included in input matrix (in case file)
    0.  C{BUS_I}       bus number (1 to 29997)
    1.  C{BUS_TYPE}    bus type (1 = PQ, 2 = PV, 3 = ref, 4 = isolated)
    2.  C{PD}          real power demand (MW)
    3.  C{QD}          reactive power demand (MVAr)
    4.  C{GS}          shunt conductance (MW at V = 1.0 p.u.)
    5.  C{BS}          shunt susceptance (MVAr at V = 1.0 p.u.)
    6.  C{BUS_AREA}    area number, 1-100
    7.  C{VM}          voltage magnitude (p.u.)
    8.  C{VA}          voltage angle (degrees)
    9.  C{BASE_KV}     base voltage (kV)
    10. C{ZONE}        loss zone (1-999)
    11. C{VMAX}        maximum voltage magnitude (p.u.)
    12. C{VMIN}        minimum voltage magnitude (p.u.)

columns 13-16 are added to matrix after OPF solution
they are typically not present in the input matrix

(assume OPF objective function has units, u)
    13. C{LAM_P}       Lagrange multiplier on real power mismatch (u/MW)
    14. C{LAM_Q}       Lagrange multiplier on reactive power mismatch (u/MVAr)
    15. C{MU_VMAX}     Kuhn-Tucker multiplier on upper voltage limit (u/p.u.)
    16. C{MU_VMIN}     Kuhn-Tucker multiplier on lower voltage limit (u/p.u.)

additional constants, used to assign/compare values in the C{BUS_TYPE} column
    1.  C{PQ}    PQ bus
    2.  C{PV}    PV bus
    3.  C{REF}   reference bus
    4.  C{NONE}  isolated bus
