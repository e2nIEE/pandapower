def opf(*args):
    """Solves an optimal power flow.

    Returns a C{results} dict.

    The data for the problem can be specified in one of three ways:
      1. a string (ppc) containing the file name of a PYPOWER case
      which defines the data matrices baseMVA, bus, gen, branch, and
      gencost (areas is not used at all, it is only included for
      backward compatibility of the API).
      2. a dict (ppc) containing the data matrices as fields.
      3. the individual data matrices themselves.

    The optional user parameters for user constraints (C{A, l, u}), user costs
    (C{N, fparm, H, Cw}), user variable initializer (C{z0}), and user variable
    limits (C{zl, zu}) can also be specified as fields in a case dict,
    either passed in directly or defined in a case file referenced by name.

    When specified, C{A, l, u} represent additional linear constraints on the
    optimization variables, C{l <= A*[x z] <= u}. If the user specifies an C{A}
    matrix that has more columns than the number of "C{x}" (OPF) variables,
    then there are extra linearly constrained "C{z}" variables. For an
    explanation of the formulation used and instructions for forming the
    C{A} matrix, see the MATPOWER manual.

    A generalized cost on all variables can be applied if input arguments
    C{N}, C{fparm}, C{H} and C{Cw} are specified. First, a linear transformation
    of the optimization variables is defined by means of C{r = N * [x z]}.
    Then, to each element of C{r} a function is applied as encoded in the
    C{fparm} matrix (see MATPOWER manual). If the resulting vector is named
    C{w}, then C{H} and C{Cw} define a quadratic cost on w:
    C{(1/2)*w'*H*w + Cw * w}. C{H} and C{N} should be sparse matrices and C{H}
    should also be symmetric.

    The optional C{ppopt} vector specifies PYPOWER options. If the OPF
    algorithm is not explicitly set in the options PYPOWER will use the default
    solver, based on a primal-dual interior point method. For the AC OPF this
    is C{OPF_ALG = 560}. For the DC OPF, the default is C{OPF_ALG_DC = 200}.
    See L{ppoption} for more details on the available OPF solvers and other OPF
    options and their default values.

    The solved case is returned in a single results dict (described
    below). Also returned are the final objective function value (C{f}) and a
    flag which is C{True} if the algorithm was successful in finding a solution
    (success). Additional optional return values are an algorithm specific
    return status (C{info}), elapsed time in seconds (C{et}), the constraint
    vector (C{g}), the Jacobian matrix (C{jac}), and the vector of variables
    (C{xr}) as well as the constraint multipliers (C{pimul}).

    The single results dict is a PYPOWER case struct (ppc) with the
    usual baseMVA, bus, branch, gen, gencost fields, along with the
    following additional fields:

        - C{order}      see 'help ext2int' for details of this field
