        Explanation of code:
        To understand the concept the CSR storage method should be known. See:
        https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_Row_Storage

        J has the shape
        | J11 | J12 |               | (pvpq, pvpq) | (pvpq, pq) |
        | --------- | = dimensions: | ------------------------- |
        | J21 | J22 |               |  (pq, pvpq)  |  (pq, pq)  |

        We first iterate the rows of J11 and J12 (for r in range lpvpq) and add the entries which are stored in dS_dV
        Then we iterate the rows of J21 and J22 (for r in range lpq) and add the entries from dS_dV

        Note: The row and column pointer of of dVm and dVa are the same as the one from Ybus
