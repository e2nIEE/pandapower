    Loads the Schutterwald network, a generic 0.4 kV network serviced by 14 MV/LV transformer
    stations of the Oberrhein network.
    The network supplies 1506 customers with the option of including 1251 heat pumps.

    The network also includes geographical information of lines and buses for plotting.
