"""Defines constants for named column indices to branch matrix.

Some examples of usage, after defining the constants using the line above,
are::

    branch[3, BR_STATUS] = 0              # take branch 4 out of service
    Ploss = branch[:, PF] + branch[:, PT] # compute real power loss vector

The index, name and meaning of each column of the branch matrix is given
below:

columns 0-10 must be included in input matrix (in case file)
    0.  C{F_BUS}       from bus number
    1.  C{T_BUS}       to bus number
    2.  C{BR_R}        resistance (p.u.)
    3.  C{BR_X}        reactance (p.u.)
    4.  C{BR_B}        total line charging susceptance (p.u.)
    5.  C{RATE_A}      MVA rating A (long term rating)
    6.  C{RATE_B}      MVA rating B (short term rating)
    7.  C{RATE_C}      MVA rating C (emergency rating)
    8.  C{TAP}         transformer off nominal turns ratio
    9.  C{SHIFT}       transformer phase shift angle (degrees)
    10. C{BR_STATUS}   initial branch status, 1 - in service, 0 - out of service
    11. C{ANGMIN}      minimum angle difference, angle(Vf) - angle(Vt) (degrees)
    12. C{ANGMAX}      maximum angle difference, angle(Vf) - angle(Vt) (degrees)

columns 13-16 are added to matrix after power flow or OPF solution
they are typically not present in the input matrix
    13. C{PF}          real power injected at "from" bus end (MW)
    14. C{QF}          reactive power injected at "from" bus end (MVAr)
    15. C{PT}          real power injected at "to" bus end (MW)
    16. C{QT}          reactive power injected at "to" bus end (MVAr)

columns 17-18 are added to matrix after OPF solution
they are typically not present in the input matrix

(assume OPF objective function has units, C{u})
    17. C{MU_SF}       Kuhn-Tucker multiplier on MVA limit at "from" bus (u/MVA)
    18. C{MU_ST}       Kuhn-Tucker multiplier on MVA limit at "to" bus (u/MVA)

columns 19-20 are added to matrix after SCOPF solution
they are typically not present in the input matrix

(assume OPF objective function has units, C{u})
    19. C{MU_ANGMIN}   Kuhn-Tucker multiplier lower angle difference limit
    20. C{MU_ANGMAX}   Kuhn-Tucker multiplier upper angle difference limit
