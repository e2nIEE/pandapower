Setup
----------

#. If you have not done it yet: create a github account
#. Create a fork of the official pandapower repository (see https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)  
#. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
#. Copy the following configuration at the bottom of to the pandapower/.git/gitconfig file (the .git folder is hidden, so you might have to enable showing hidden folders) and insert your github username:

.. code-block:: 

    [remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/pp/*
        pushurl = https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/pandapower.git
    [remote "pp"]
        url = https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/pp/*
    [remote "pp_fork"]
        url = https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/pandapower.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/pp_fork/*
    [branch "develop"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/develop
        
The develop branch is now configured to automatically track the official pandapower develop branch. So if you pull the develop branch, it will by default pull from the official repository.
Since you cannot push directly to the official pandapower repository, pushes are by default routed to your own fork instead of the official pandapower repository.
